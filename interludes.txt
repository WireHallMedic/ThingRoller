Tragedy: Describe a tale of tragedy or misfortune from your hero's past, featuring one of their traits if possible. If the teller has a dark secret of some kind, hint strongly at it, drop clues, or otherwise give the rest of the group a glimpse into your hero's dark side during your narrative. 
Victory: Tell the group about a great victory or personal triumph in your adventurer's past. How did it affect them afterward? Was there a reward?
Love: Speak fondly of the character's greatest love; lost, found, or waiting on them back home. What is the love's name? Where do they live? Why is the traveler not with them now?
Desire: Tell a tale about something your hero wants (or already has). It might be a material possession, recognition, a political goal, or even a trip they wish to take to some amazing destination.
