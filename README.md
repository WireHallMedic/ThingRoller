ThingRoller is a Discord bot for random generation.

ThingRoller expects (and will fail to launch without) a file called 'token.txt' at the same level as the executable, which contains the bot's token. Getting the token and adding the bot to a Discord server are handled in the Discord developer portal.

Calling '!ThingRoller' will print a table of contents.
